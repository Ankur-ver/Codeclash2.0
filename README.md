# Hunarify – Turning Hunar into Rozgaar

**Hunarify** is an AI-powered platform that empowers skilled individuals from small towns and rural India to earn online by showcasing their talent (*hunar*) without needing English proficiency, laptops, or prior freelancing experience.

## Project Motivation:
  Many talented individuals – from women who do mehndi or stitching, to students skilled in video editing or cooking – struggle to access platforms like Fiverr or Upwork due to:
- Language barriers (English proficiency)
- Lack of digital literacy
- No access to laptops or complex signup processes

**Hunarify bridges this gap** by enabling these users to speak in their local language, auto-generating professional freelance profiles, proposals, and portfolios, and connecting them to job opportunities via WhatsApp.
